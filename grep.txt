# match string at the beginning of the line
grep "^GNU" file

# match every line ending with GNU
grep "GNU$" file

# match any character
grep -E "Saved . billable events"

# match one or more occurence
grep -E "Saved .+ billable events"


Bracket

# find the lines that contain "too" or "two"
grep "t[wo]o" GPL-3

# match anything except the characters within a bracket by beginning the list of characters within the brackets with a "^" character.
grep "[^c]ode" GPL-3
# will not match the pattern "code", it will match "Mode"

# find every line that begins with a capital letter
grep "^[A-Z]" GPL-3


Repeat Pattern Zero or More Times
#  "*", which means "repeat the previous character or expression zero or more times".
# find each line that contained an opening and closing parenthesis, with only letters and single spaces in between, we could use the following expression:
grep "([A-Za-z ]*)" GPL-3


# To match a character zero or one times, you can use the "?" character. This makes character or character set that came before optional, in essence.
# The following matches "copyright" and "right" by putting "copy" in an optional group:
grep -E "(copy)?right" GPL-3

# The following expression matches the string "free" plus one or more characters that are not whitespace:
grep -E "free[^[:space:]]+" GPL-3


Specifying Match Repetition
If we need to specify the number of times that a match is repeated, we can use the brace characters ("{" and "}").

# if we want to find all of the lines that contain triple-vowels, we can use the following expression:
grep -E "[AEIOUaeiou]{3}" GPL-3

#  match any words that have between 16 and 20 characters
grep -E "[[:alpha:]]{16,20}" GPL-3




       ?      The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
       *      The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
       +      The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
       {n}    The preceding item is matched exactly n times.
       {n,}   The preceding item is matched n or more times.
       {,m}   The preceding item is matched at most m times.  This is a GNU extension.
       {n,m}  The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times.
